## Project Overview

  In this project we created an application that allows a user to create an idea and save it to a card. The card is then shown in a gallery of cards. The user can then add more ideas, delete ideas, or mark ideas as "starred." The user can also filter the ideas to show only those that have been marked as "starred."

![Empty Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61127453/79398448-fb0eb880-7f3d-11ea-8698-95be9bd55927.png)

  By entering a Title and Body into the form and clicking the 'Save' button, the user can store their new idea.

![Idea Create](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61127453/79398504-14b00000-7f3e-11ea-82b2-8e4f17946384.png)

  The idea that the user creates will appear in a card below. Each idea will be contained in a card and will be displayed in the Idea Gallery.

![One Idea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61127453/79398516-18dc1d80-7f3e-11ea-88d8-ddc0724b7213.png)

  By entering more than one idea into the form and clicking the submit button, we can create a set of ideas that display in the gallery. By storing the array of ideas in local storage we are able to retain this list of ideas if the user reloads the page.

![Many Ideas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61127453/79398521-1bd70e00-7f3e-11ea-8c83-d5ba73fe7551.png)

  That screenplay idea was terrible, but we can delete it by clicking on the 'X' button.

  But that whiskey hose idea is genius! Let's mark it starred by clicking the star, because I don't want to forget it.

  Now I just want a list of my starred ideas. By clicking on the "Show Starred Ideas" button I can display a list of only those ideas that have been starred. By clicking the button again, I can show all of my ideas once more.

![Filtered Ideas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61127453/79399071-918fa980-7f3f-11ea-8c55-110ab5f98e59.png)

  If the user makes wants to look at the application on their phone, or if they make the width of their browser window small enough, special stying will take effect.
